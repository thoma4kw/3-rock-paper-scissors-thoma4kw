## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I would like a hold on grading if possible until we figure out whats going on with my npm commands, for this project my webpage also stopped loading after i comminted steps 1-3 the page worked but once i started working with the js the site failed to load and my attempt at debugging did not help. 

## Self-Reflection:
I thought I was fine working on the project since i have created one of these before but when my webpage stopped loading i was unsure of what to do 


### How long it took me to finish this?
Around 4 hours in total with about an hour of that being me trying to debug
